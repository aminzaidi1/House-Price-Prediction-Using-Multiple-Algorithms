# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Multiple-Algorithms
Hey! In this repo I'll be predicting house prices with multiple feature variables after doing in depth exploratory data analysis. I'll be implementing multiple algorithms and then coming to conclusion about the best 3 based on the accuracy score. Might do a little deep learning as well implementing neural networks or multi layer perceptron.


200 apartments located in different areas of Pune.
Data set containes 17 different variables. 
Modelling to predict the price for similar apartments not included in dataset.
Prediction depends not only on the apartment qualities but also on the location.
Implementing Multiple LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Suport Vector, K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest Regressora and XGBoost and then comparing the each of them to check which algorithm fits best in our case.
